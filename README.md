Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (ML.ipynb) that walks through a complete machine learning pipeline on an Airbnb listings dataset. The goals of the project are:

Data Ingestion & Merging
Import multiple Airbnb-related CSV files, concatenate them into a single DataFrame, and prepare for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
Explore summary statistics, visualize distributions of key features, and identify patterns or correlations.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values, detect and treat outliers, perform feature selection, one-hot encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features.

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensionality and visualize explained variance.

Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) on the PCA-transformed data, generate cluster summaries, and interpret group characteristics.

Supervised Learning (Regression Modeling)
Split the data into training and testing sets, train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso) to predict a target variable (e.g., listing price), evaluate performance (MSE, MAE, R²), and compare results.

By following this notebook step-by-step, you will learn how to take raw Airbnb data from ingestion all the way through model evaluation.

Data Description
All raw data files (CSVs) are assumed to live in a folder called Dataset/. The notebook expects you to structure your files like this:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
airbnb-project/
├── Dataset/
│   ├── listings_part1.csv
│   ├── listings_part2.csv
│   ├── reviews.csv
│   └── ... (other CSVs you have)
├── ML.ipynb
└── README.md
Note: Replace the filenames above with your actual CSV filenames. The notebook’s code references folder_path = '/content/Dataset', so if you move the notebook off of Google Colab, update folder_path to the local path (e.g., ./Dataset) accordingly.

Typical columns in the raw listings CSVs include (but are not limited to):

id

name

latitude, longitude

room_type

person_capacity

price (or a similar target feature like realSum)

guest_satisfaction_overall

number_of_reviews

availability_365

...and more.

Notebook Structure
Below is a high-level outline of the sections in ML.ipynb:

Import Libraries

pandas, numpy, os for data handling

seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot for visualization

sklearn modules for preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and modeling

Import Datasets

Load all CSV files from Dataset/ into individual DataFrames

Store them in a list, then concatenate into a single “master” DataFrame

Combine Datasets

Merge or concatenate as needed (e.g., join listings with reviews, if applicable)

Drop duplicate rows (if any)

Data Exploration & Visualization

Display head/tail of data, summary statistics (.describe()), data types

Visualize distributions of numerical features (histograms, boxplots)

Plot categorical counts or bar charts for room types, neighborhoods, etc.

Data Cleaning

Check for null/missing values and impute or drop as appropriate

Detect outliers (IQR method, z-score) and decide whether to cap, remove, or keep them

Drop irrelevant columns (e.g., IDs or columns with too many missing values)

Feature Selection / Engineering

Correlation matrix to identify highly correlated features

Possibly drop or combine features for multicollinearity reduction

Create new features (e.g., total stay cost, review rates, etc.)

One-Hot Encoding

Convert categorical variables (e.g., room_type, neighborhood, cancellation_policy) into dummy/indicator variables

Feature Scaling

Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler

(Optional) Compare StandardScaler vs. MinMaxScaler if necessary

Data Splitting

Define X (feature matrix) and y (target vector, e.g., price or realSum)

Split into training and testing sets via train_test_split(test_size=0.20, random_state=42)

PCA Analysis

Fit PCA on the scaled training features

Examine explained variance ratio, generate a scree plot

Transform X_train and X_test into the reduced principal component space

Clustering

Apply KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42) on PCA-transformed features

Compute silhouette score to choose an optimal k

Produce a cluster summary table (mean values of important features per cluster)

Visualize clusters (e.g., colors on two leading principal components)

Modeling (Regression)

Instantiate multiple regression models:

LinearRegression()

Ridge(alpha=1.0)

Lasso(alpha=1.0)

Train each on X_train, y_train

Compute metrics on both train/test sets:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² score

Tabulate results in a Pandas DataFrame and print comparisons

Conclusions & Next Steps

Interpret which model performed best

Outline suggestions for future work: hyperparameter tuning, additional features, different clustering algorithms, or even deep learning approaches

Installation & Setup
Clone this repository (or download the .ipynb and dataset folder):

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/airbnb-ml-project.git
cd airbnb-ml-project
Install Python 3.7+ (recommended) and create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
Install Dependencies
The core libraries needed are listed below under Dependencies. You can install them via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or, if you don’t have a requirements.txt, install individually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
Prepare the Dataset Folder

Create a Dataset/ directory in the project root.

Copy all raw CSV files (e.g., listings.csv, reviews.csv, etc.) into Dataset/.

If you are using Google Colab, simply mount your Google Drive and update the path accordingly (e.g., folder_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/airbnb-files').

Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook ML.ipynb
This will open the notebook in your browser.

Step through each section

Verify the import paths.

Run each cell in order.

Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., number of PCA components, number of clusters, regression alpha values) in the designated cells as desired.

View Outputs

EDA visualizations and plots will appear inline.

The final DataFrame of regression results (results_df) will show a side-by-side comparison of Train vs. Test metrics for each model.

Modify for Your Own Data

If your dataset uses different column names, update the column references in the “Data Cleaning” and “Feature Selection” sections.

You can also swap in different supervised models (e.g., RandomForestRegressor, XGBoost) by installing the appropriate packages and updating the “Modeling” cell.

Dependencies
The following Python packages (and their minimum versions) are required to run this notebook:

pandas (≥ 1.0)

numpy (≥ 1.18)

seaborn (≥ 0.10)

matplotlib (≥ 3.0)

scikit-learn (≥ 0.22)

jupyter (for running notebooks interactively)

If you want to freeze versions, you can create a requirements.txt file like this:

shell
